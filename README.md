In the assignment, I will analyze the billboards dataset. I will be using the tidyverse library to tidy billboards dataset in order to 
make it easier to access and pleasing to look at.
I will also be demonstrating the different types of join and merge functions available through dplyr and base R. 
Finally, I will be investigating the match function provided by base R and seeing how it relates to the merge and join functions respectively.
